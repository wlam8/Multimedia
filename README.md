Multimedia
==========


This is a quarter long assignment for a Multimedia course.
The instructor provided the code for image input and output which converts a bitmap image into a custom class.

In the main menu, only 1. Aliasing works because I no longer have the sample files for the other options.

To run, download the entire src folder and run Aliasing.cmd 



Example:

Thickness of each circle in pixels: 2

Difference between sucessive radii in pixels: 4

Number to subsample by: 4
